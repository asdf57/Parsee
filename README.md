# Parsee

Parsee is a web scraping utility intended to be utilized strictly from the terminal. On the surface, Parsee appears to function similarly to wget or curl. Parsee comes into its own due to the fact that you can execute xpath and jpath expressions directly from the terminal on a website of your choosing.

Additionally, Parsee allows for a user to output the innter text and outer html of a site directly into stdin, meaning you can then pipe this output into different statements in a shell like Bash or Zsh.
